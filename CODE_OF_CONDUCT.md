# Royal Sampler : Web : CODE OF CONDUCT

## 1. Purpose

Providing guidance on code of conduct for this project, so that we are all on the same page. The code of conduct page. [[Here it is.|CODE_OF_CONDUCT]]

## 2. Open Citizenship

Like the film:
- Service guarantees citizenship.
- I'm doing my part.

## 3. Expected Behaviour

The following behaviours are expected & actively encouraged:
- Being me.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviours are unacceptable & yet rarely discouraged:
- Not being me.

## 5. Weapons Policy

- No weapons Gary.
- 4 letter words not War.
- Inept code not weaponised toad.
- Would you like to play a game? ... No!

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

- World War Two.
- Ruined carpet.
- Turning the car around and going home.
- Barely audible tutting.

Not sure how listing these is helping tbh.

## 7. Reporting Guidelines

- What can I tell you buddy. Take it up with consumer affairs.

## 8. Addressing Grievances

- What can I tell you buddy. Take it up with your local post office.

## 9. Scope

- ACOG (Breaks rule No 5).
- Silent (Arcade Cabinet).

## 10. Contact info

- See No 7.

## 11. License and attribution exasperation

So apparently "Code of Conducts" have a Licence. But that's different from the LICENCE I just added. So then do we need another CODE_OF_CONDUCT for updating this new LICENCE? And then that CODE_OF_CONDUCT needs a LICENCE? Any chance I'll ever get to do some programming again? If it means the typescript compiler gets to say rude things about me then so be it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
